The difference between npm install --save vs. npm install --save-dev

npm install --save is used for components that run your app. Examples
include jquery, angular, ionic, etc.

npm install --save-dev is used for helpful components that aid in
development, but aren't required to run your app. Examples include jest,
grunt, gulp, etc.
