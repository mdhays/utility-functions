The difference between npm install --save vs. npm install --save-dev

npm install --save is used for components that run your app. Examples
include jquery, angular, ionic, etc.

npm install --save-dev is used for helpful components that aid in
development, but aren't required to run your app. Examples include jest,
grunt, gulp, etc.


Versioning for packages.

Use this format; version major.minor.patch. For instace in something
that's at version 1.2.3, 1 is major, 2 is minor, 3 is patch level
changes.

Major changes are anything that can break your app. Basically it makes
your app non-backwards compatible.

Minor changes are things that aren't likely to break things, but aren't
small enough to be patches. Things like adding a function to a module
would qualify as minor changes.

Patches are things like bug fixes that are very small changes to your
app.
